# 🎯 Focus Timer

This project aims to create a custom focus timer to help manage study or work sessions.
Users can define a study duration and optionally include breaks. The timer cycles between “focus” and “break” periods (e.g., Focus → Break → Focus).

Currently, the built-in Windows Focus mode doesn’t provide to me a satisfying user experience it’s too large, non-responsive, and often hidden in another tab, making it easy to forget to resume after breaks.

The goal is to build a compact, Spotify-like floating timer widget that stays visible on the screen edge.
It should include simple controls (start, pause, resume, skip break, etc.) and a responsive design for convenience.

## 💡 Potential future features:

Customizable themes or minimal UI modes

Sound or notification alerts for transitions

Statistics on total focus time

Integration with to-do lists or calendars

Keyboard shortcuts for quick control

Optional “auto-resume” after breaks
